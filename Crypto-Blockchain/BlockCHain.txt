Blockhain - it was started to stop tampering of data by storing the infoormation inside blocks and then use those blocks to connect them by storing the addresses of next,previous blocks

Benifits:-

* if someone tries to edit the block will fil as it will loose the trailing block or previous block 
* if someone is trying to change block address then one would have to create these blocks in all decentralised systems.


Note:- blockchain is kind of DB which stores the data in form block and uses these blocks to connect each other by storing addresses.

Each block stores address , data in the from of HASH
Each node in the n/w stores the replica of blockchain, also each node updates itself by connecting to the n/w and using the same ot updat the transactions


*   How to become a part of the decentralised sysytem?
ans.You need to act as a client for the decntralised system.
	
	As the blockhain becomes so big and really difficult to store data on small systems (nodes)
	We need different clients(Nodes) for accessing the block chain:- 
	
	1. Full Nodes.
	2. Archive Nodes.
	3. Light Clients
	4. Stateless Clients
