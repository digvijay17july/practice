Array complexity for CRUD Operations :-

1. add() – takes O(1)
2. add(index, element) – in average runs in O(n) time
3. get() – is always a constant time O(1) operation
4. remove() – runs in linear O(n) time. We have to iterate the entire array to find the element qualifying for removal
5. indexOf() – O(n)

HAsh Table complexity for CRUD Operations:-


1. add() - O(1)
2. get() - O(1)
3. delete() - O(1)
4. search() - O(1)
