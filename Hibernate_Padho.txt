hibernate over Ejb 
---in Ejbs  session beans are  required to contact to ejb to access data
--- ejbs require application server to maintain ejbs so more cost would be required
--- hibernate and ejb both are designed by galvingking
--- ejbs and session beans we need wrap and deploy in the form of ear.
--- hiberante only requires jvm and jre
-
hibernate provides features like-

--validation supports by using annotation(as java recommended(JSR303))
--auto ddl(tables automatically created in db)
--cache support
--hibernate is exception free , only runtime exception , no compile time exception
--hibernate is orm but jdbc is table/relation mapping
-- HQL(Database independent query)
--primary key generator support
--ORM Support(Relational database)
--OGM Support(NON SQL Support from hibernate 4)(Object graph mapping)
--Hibernate Search(index based hibernate 4)
--connection pool implementation


Hibernate Object types--

3 types of object--
  --transient-> create object but not attached to hibernate
  --persisted-> create object and attached to hibernate
  --detached -> from hibernate if you remove it after making data permanent
  
Things required to use hibernate --
Pojo 
Mapping file
Configuration file
Test Class

--POJO Rule
  --Default constructor should be there
  --public setter and getters
  
  
 ---> What is the difference between get and load in Hibernate?
get vs load is one of the most frequently asked Hibernate Interview question,
 since correct understanding of both get() and load() is require to effectively using Hibernate. Main difference between get and load is that, get will hit 
 the database if object is not found in the cache and returned completely initialized object, which may involve several database call while load() method can return proxy,
 if object is not found in cache and only hit database if any method other than getId() is called. This can save a lot of performance in some cases. You can also see a
 difference between get and load in Hibernate for more differences and detailed discussion on this question.


What is the difference between save, persist and saveOrUpdate methods in Hibernate?
After get vs load, this is another Hibernate Interview question which appears quite often. All three methods i.e. save(), saveOrUpdate() and persist() 
is used to save objects into database, but has subtle differences e.g. save() can only INSERT records but saveOrUpdate() can either INSERT or UPDATE records.
 Also, the return type of save() is a Serializable object, while return type of persist() method is void. You can also check save vs persist vs saveOrUpdate for complete differences between them in hibernate.
