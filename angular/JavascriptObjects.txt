   {property:value...
   method:function()}
   
 2. constructor function 
	It is a function that receives and "empty object". adds properties and methods to that object .so they will be full of methods 
	and properties.
	use "constructor function".if you want to create an object based on a specific/list of fields
	function constructorFunction()
	{
	this.value=value;
	}
	console.log(new constructorFunction());
