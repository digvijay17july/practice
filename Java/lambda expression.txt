Why lambda expression?
To enable functional programming in java 
It is closure or anonymous function.

No modifier
No return type
No name 
Any no. Of arguments
For one argument parenthesis are not mandatory 
Not mandatory to write type of arguments

Curly braces are not mandatory 

We can call lambda expression through functional interfaces


Functional interfaces----
Those interfaces which have single abstract method 

Use @FunctionalInterface annotation

For holding lambda expression we need functional interfaces
