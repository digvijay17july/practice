Tomcat command to run in debug mode-

(Java Platform Debugger Architecture) in file setenv.sh

JPDA_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n"

catalina.sh jpda start


What these settings basically do is to enable remote debugging and configure available options: specifying the communication protocol between the running application and the debugger, (ie transport=dt_socket) the port at which the remote application should debugged (ie address=1403). The server=y setting indicates that this JVM would be the one to be debugged while suspend=n is used to tell the JVM to execute right away and not wait for an attached debugger. If set to “y” then the application would be suspended and not run until a debugger is attached.
