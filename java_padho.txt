Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language.
For example the 4 suits in a deck of playing cards may be 4 enumerators named Club, Diamond, Heart, and Spade, belonging to an enumerated type named Suit.

jstat--------
We can use jstat command line tool to monitor the JVM memory and garbage collection activities. 
It ships with standard JDK, so you donâ€™t need to do anything else to get it.

For executing jstat you need to know the process id of the application, you can get it easily using ps -eaf | grep java command.
jstat -gc 9582 1000


*****What is required to try with resource?

-----The resource should implement AutoCloseable interface.

*****What is supplier interface?
-----The Supplier interface signature is as below, which represents a supplier of results.

     @FunctionalInterface

     public interface Supplier

     Here, T is the type of results supplied by this supplier.
	
*****What is Consumer?
-----java.util.function.Consumer is a functional interface. Like Supplier, it has one abstract functional method accept(T t)and a default method andThen(Consumer<? super T> after)

     Note: Default methods are not abstract methods.

     The Consumer interface signature is as below, which represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.

     @FunctionalInterface

     public interface Consumer
 ------
	 default Consumer < T > andThen(Consumer << ? super T > after) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(after);
    return (T t) - > {
        accept(t);after.accept(t);
    };
}
