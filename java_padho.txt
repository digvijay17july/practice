jstat--------
We can use jstat command line tool to monitor the JVM memory and garbage collection activities. 
It ships with standard JDK, so you donâ€™t need to do anything else to get it.

For executing jstat you need to know the process id of the application, you can get it easily using ps -eaf | grep java command.
jstat -gc 9582 1000
