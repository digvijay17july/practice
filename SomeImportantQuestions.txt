Abstract Class vs Interface Class --

RealTime Example--

For Interface:
Interface is used when you don't know anything about implementation but know the contract that implementer should have to accomplish the task.
For Abstract class:
Abstract class is used when you know partial implementation, where say out of 5 methods, you know implementation of 3 methods and don't know implemenatation of 2 methods in that case 2 methods will be abstract and you need to rely on implementer as a contract to must provide body of abstract methods to accomplish the task.

----------
All requests you make have their HTTP status codes. There are a lot of them and they are divided into 5 classes. The first number indicates which of them a code belongs to:

1xx - informational;
2xx - success;
3xx - redirection;
4xx - client error;
5xx - server error.
-------------
HTTP vs Rest--------------

No, REST is the way HTTP should be used.

Today we only use a tiny bit of the HTTP protocol's methods â€“ namely GET and POST. The REST way to do it is to use all of the protocol's methods.

For example, REST dictates the usage of DELETE to erase a document (be it a file, state, etc.) behind a URI, whereas, with HTTP, you would misuse a GET or POST query like ...product/?delete_id=22.
