My Weakness and my strengths----
 I have several strengths namely – I am patient, committed, honest and self-motivated. 
 one of my weaknesses is that I trust people very easily

You have changed jobs/jumped ship too many times already, why so? -----
“You may label me a ‘frequent career-changer’ but I genuinely feel that today I am a far better employee. My switches have helped me develop better interpersonal skills, gain diverse skills and adapt to rapidly changing business environments. I can solve problems more efficiently and creatively, as I have learned to live with ambiguity and uncertainty. My first job helped me develop patience. My second job helped me master spreadsheets and numbers. My third job helped me develop better people skills and also adjust amidst culturally diverse and geographically dispersed teams. All in all, I feel that my varied background makes me an ideal candidate for this job role today.”


Did you ever have a conflict with your current/previous boss or professor?-----

NO , I haven't faced any conflict till now but i suggested some idea in the team which were not taken at that time but after that i created a poc and a presentation for the same which helped me later to explain my idea and improve the performance of team.

Did you ever have a conflict with your current/previous boss or professor?
“Since I like to build strong professional relationships with my teammates, most of them have become great friends. We have been spending eight hours a day, five days a week for several years now. So, I am sure that whatever they say, will be realistic and not made up. One thing that they will surely mention about me is my love for food! The rest is up to you to find out.”
